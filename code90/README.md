# Dark Forest

(code90, solved by 94)

## Description

Someone pre-ordered a forest and now I'm lost in it. There are a lot of binary trees in front and behind of me. Some are smaller or equal-sized than others. Can you help me to invert the path and find out of the forest? Hint: It's about (inverted) BSTs. Don't forget the spaces.
